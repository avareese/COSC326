resources used:
For this etude many resources were used to help make a working program. We had to use online tutorials on how to learn how to code properly in c++. This took a long time. We also used resources to find our mulitply, findDiff and findSum functions.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiply-large-numbers-represented-as-strings/

We also gained inspiration from our fellow classmates during pitch my etude with how to do the division and remainder methods.

to run the program complie with g++ main.cpp (i am assuming you have a main class to run it by) and run with ./a.out
