Libraries used:

For our program we just imported in the java.util.* library which gave me access to the scanner class which we then used for user input to get our n and k.

Test cases:

We tested on a range of numbers to find the binomal coefficent
some test cases used were
10, 5 = 252
6,4 = 15
5, 2 = 10
7, 3 = 35
4, 2 = 6
8, 4 = 70
8, 3 = 56
10, 6 = 210
12, 7 = 792
30, 10 = 30045015
35, 20 = 3247943160
8, 2 = 28
66, 33 = 27443164008374997

Rescourses used:
To grasp how binomal coefficents worked I used the resource 'geeksforgeeks'.
